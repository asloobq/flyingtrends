============
Flappy Bird style game created using Cocos2d-JS.
### [Demo](http://cs.binghamton.edu/~aquresh4/Misc/cocos2d-html5-v2.2.3/flyingtrends/)###
Todo:

1. Add 3 lives.
2. Add background music.
3. Add a 'Controls help' screen.
4. Port to iOS / Android.
5. Animated superman's cape while flying.
6. Save high scores.
7. Make it Social.
8. Increasing difficulty levels.


### Setting up development environment ###

1. Download the Cocos2d-JS SDK from [the cocos2d-x download page] (http://cocos2d-x.org/download) . (Direct Link to SDK [here](http://cdn.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-html5-v2.2.3.zip))
2. Unzip the file anywhere on disk (/cocos2djs).
3. Clone this repository in the cocos2djs folder (/cocos2djs/flyingtrends).
4. Open index.html in a browser (/cocos2djs/flyingtrends/index.html). If the game does not run then you probably need to use a server like wamp. More help [here](http://cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Cocos2d-js).
